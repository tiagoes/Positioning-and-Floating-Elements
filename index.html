          Alan Guth was one of the first physicists to hypothesize the existence
          of inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly
          and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years
          ago.<span>Rick Friedman for The New York Times</span>

          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
          for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
          beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
          and drew a double box around it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported
          that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his
          hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
